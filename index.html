  <h1>Campbell to NetCDF Utilities</h1>
      <p>We use <a href="http://campbellsci.com">Campbell Scientific</a> dataloggers in our environmental research. Like many users, we have multiple loggers at just one site, each collecting multiple data tables. For ease of analysis, we want to herd these tables into a single file or database that supports querying across all of our information. Further, we need to document metadata from a diverse set of sources; this extra documentation is key for ensuring that the data can be shared across labs.</p>
      <p>Here's our solution: a set of utilities for processing the Campbell Scientific data file format into a self-described <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> file. Along the way, we provide support for generating XML files of additional metadata such as calibration schedules, instrument information, and observation units. </p>
<div id="solution"></div>
      <p>Our work flow is to make a single daily NetCDF file for each day in the record. We then create versions or levels of the file as we engage in post-processing (for example, raw data is verision 0 of the NetCDF, data that has undergone QA/QC will be in the version 1 of the file, flux calculations and other derived measurements will be in version 2). However, we aim to be flexible by providing configuration files so you can target these utilities to your needs. Or, the complete source is available on github, so feel free to fork our project!</p>
